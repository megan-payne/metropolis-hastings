# Metropolis Hastings

This is an implementation of the Metropolis Hastings algorithm in R. I wrote this code for a talk I gave on the algorithm 
for the master's program in biostatistics. 

The Metropolis Hastings algorithm is a MCMC (Markov chain Monte Carlo) process for sampling from a 
probability distribution when direct sampling is difficult.
